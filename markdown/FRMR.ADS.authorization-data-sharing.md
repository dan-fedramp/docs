### Documentation Guidelines

The following FedRAMP documentation guidelines apply to this document:

- The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
- FedRAMP-specific terms defined in [FRD-ALL (FedRAMP Definitions)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/docs/blob/main/markdown/FRMR.FRD.fedramp-definitions.md) are italicized throughout this document for reference.


## Background & Authority
- [44 USC § 3609 (a)(8)](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2023-title44/USCODE-2023-title44-chap36-sec3609) The FedRAMP Authorization Act directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to &quot;provide a secure mechanism for storing and sharing necessary data, including FedRAMP authorization packages, to enable better reuse of such packages across agencies, including making available any information and data necessary for agencies...&quot;
- [OMB Memorandum M-24-15 on Modernizing FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf) Section 6 states that &quot;In general, to encourage both security and agility, Federal agencies should use the same infrastructure relied on by the rest of CSPs&#x27; commercial customer base.&quot;

### Purpose

Modern cloud services store and share security and compliance information in convenient repositories that allow customers to rapidly review security information and gain access to additional information as needed. These services often include automated integration with cloud service infrastructure to remove manual burden and ensure information is accurate and up to date.

This security and compliance information (including FedRAMP authorization data) is the intellectual property of the cloud service provider and is not _federal customer data_ in most cases.* The federal government benefits when the same security information is shared among all customers and even the public to ensure maximum transparency and accountability of cloud service providers.

The FedRAMP Authorization Data Sharing Standard provides a process or mechanism for cloud service providers to store and share authorization data on their preferred platform of choice if it meets certain FedRAMP requirements.

At the initial release of this standard there will not be many platforms that directly support the requirements in this standard. FedRAMP anticipates this will change rapidly in response to market demand as platforms work to provide innovative solutions to these requirements.

_* Providers with questions about this should consult with a lawyer who specializes in procurement law. Typically a contract with the government granting ownership of information is required to transfer ownership to the government._

### Expected Outcomes

- Cloud service providers will be able to manage authorization data in the same platforms used for commercial customers, reusing data as appropriate
- Federal agencies will be able to access necessary authorization data via API or other automated mechanisms integrated into agency authorization systems to simplify the burden of review and continuous monitoring
- Trust center providers and GRC automation tool providers will develop innovative solutions and improvements to ensure standardized automated data sharing and validation within the FedRAMP ecosystem

# Technical assistance

### FRA-ADS

**Purpose:** This Technical Assistance helps stakeholders understand the intent behind the requirements in the FedRAMP _authorization data_ Sharing Standard.

**Disclaimer:** Every cloud service provider is different, every architecture is different, and every environment is different. Best practices and technical assistance MUST NOT be used as a checklist. All examples are for discussion purposes ONLY.

****

#### FRA-ADS-04

&quot;Without interruption&quot; means that parties should not have to request manual approval each time they need to access _authorization data_ or go through a complicated process. The preferred way of ensuring access without interruption is to use on-demand just-in-time access provisioning.


---   
    

#### FRA-ADS-05

This is not a license to exclude accurate risk information, but specifics that would _likely_ lead to compromise should be abstracted. A breach of confidentiality with _authorization data_ should be anticipated by a secure cloud service provider.

##### Examples of unnecessary sensitive information in _authorization data_

Key Tests:

- Passwords, API keys, access credentials, etc.
- Excessive detail about methodology that exposes weaknesses
- Personally identifiable information about employees

Examples:

- DON&#x27;T: &quot;In an emergency, an administrator with physical access to a system can log in using &quot;secretadmin&quot; with the password &quot;pleasewutno&quot;&quot; DO: &quot;In an emergency, administrators with physical access can log in directly.&quot;
- DON&#x27;T: &quot;All backup MFA credentials are stored in a SuperSafe Series 9000 safe in the CEOs office.&quot; DO: &quot;All backup MFA credentials are stored in a UL Class 350 safe in a secure location with limited access.&quot;
- DON&#x27;T: &quot;During an incident, the incident response team lead by Jim Smith (555-0505) will open a channel at the conference line (555-0101 #97808 passcode 99731)...&quot; DO: &quot;During an incident, the incident response team will coordinate over secure channels.&quot;
