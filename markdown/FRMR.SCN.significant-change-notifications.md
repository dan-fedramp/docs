## Front Matter

### Effective Date(s) & Overall Applicability

- **FedRAMP 20x**:
  - This release is effective **2025-06-17** for **20x Phase One Pilot**. 
  - These requirements apply to all participants in the FedRAMP 20x Phase One pilot.

- **FedRAMP Rev5**:
  - This release is effective **2025-07-07** for **Rev5 Closed Beta**. 
  - These requirements will be initially tested and evaluated for Rev5 in the SCN Closed Beta.
  - Providers MUST participate in a Balance Improvement Test to transition from the Significant Change Request process to the new Significant Change Notification process prior to wide release of this process for Rev5. Providers should participate in the FedRAMP Rev5 Community Working Group at https://www.fedramp.gov/community/ to follow this process.


### Documentation Guidelines

The following FedRAMP documentation guidelines apply to this document:

- The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
- FedRAMP-specific terms defined in [FRD-ALL (FedRAMP Definitions)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/docs/blob/main/markdown/FRMR.FRD.fedramp-definitions.md) are italicized throughout this document for reference.


## Background & Authority
- [FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC § 3609 (a) (7))](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2023-title44/USCODE-2023-title44-chap36-sec3609) directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to &quot;coordinate with the FedRAMP Board, the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and other entities identified by the Administrator, with the concurrence of the [OMB] Director and the [DHS] Secretary, to establish and regularly update a framework for continuous monitoring...&quot;
- [OMB Memorandum M-24-15 on Modernizing FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf) section VI states &quot;FedRAMP should seek input from CSPs and develop processes that enable CSPs to maintain an agile deployment lifecycle that does not require advance Government approval, while giving the Government the visibility and information it needs to maintain ongoing confidence in the FedRAMP-authorized system and to respond timely and appropriately to incidents.&quot;

### Purpose

The Significant Change Notification (SCN) standard establishes conditions for FedRAMP authorized cloud service providers to make most significant changes without requiring advance government approval. Agency authorizing officials who authorize the use of FedRAMP authorized cloud services are expected to account for the risk of cloud service providers making changes to improve the service.

This standard broadly identifies four types of significant changes, from least impactful to most impactful:
1. Routine Recurring
2. Adaptive
3. Transformative
4. Impact Categorization

These categories, and the resulting requirements, apply only to significant changes.

### Expected Outcomes

- Cloud service providers will securely deliver new features and capabilities for government customers at the same speed and pace of delivery for commercial customers, without needing advance government approval
- Federal agencies will have equal access to features and capabilities as commercial customers without sacrificing the visibility and information they need to maintain ongoing confidence in the service

# Technical assistance

### FRA-SCN

**Purpose:** This Technical Assistance helps stakeholders evaluate and label _significant changes_ by type as required by _FRR-SCN-03_. This assistance is designed for the 20x Phase One Pilot and Rev5 Closed Beta Balance Improvement Test. The Significant Change Notification Requirements will be tested, evaluated, and improved in partnership with stakeholders based on real-world experience.

**Disclaimer:** Every cloud service provider is different, every architecture is different, and every environment is different. Best practices and technical assistance MUST NOT be used as a checklist. All examples are for discussion purposes ONLY.

****

#### FRA-SCN-03

Once a change has been identified as a _significant change_ in general, FedRAMP recommends next determining if a change is of the type _routine recurring_. If it is not, work down from the highest impact to lowest to identify the type of change.

1. Is it a _significant change_?
2. If it is, is it a _routine recurring_ change?
3. If it is not, is it an _impact categorization_ change?
4. If it is not, is it a _transformative_ change?
5. If it is not, then it is an _adaptive_ change.

#### FRA-SCN-RR

Activities that match the _routine recurring_ _significant change_ type are performed _regularly_ and routinely by cloud service providers to address flaws or vulnerabilities, address incidents, and generally perform the typical maintenance and service delivery changes expected during day-to-day operations.

These changes leverage mature processes and capabilities to identify, mitigate, and remediate risks as part of the change. They are often entirely automated and may occur without human intervention, even though they have an impact on security of the service.

If the activity does not occur _regularly_ and routinely then it cannot be a _significant change_ of this type (e.g., replacing all physical firewalls to remediate a vulnerability is obviously not regular or routine).

##### Ongoing operations

Key Tests:

- Routine care and feeding by staff during normal duties
- No major impact to service availability
- Does not require executive approval

Examples:

- Provisioning or deprovisioning capacity to support service elasticity
- Changing or tuning performance configurations for instances or services
- Updating and maintaining operational handling of information flows and protection across physical and logical networks (e.g., updating firewall rules)
- Generating or refreshing API or access tokens
          
##### Vulnerability Management

Key Tests:

- Minor, incremental patching or updates
- Significant refactoring or migration process NOT required
- No breaking changes

Examples:

- Updating security service or endpoint signatures
- Routine patching of devices, operating systems, software or libraries
- Updating and deploying code that applies normal fixes and improvements as part of a regular development cycle
- Vulnerability remediation activity that simply replaces a known-bad component(s) with a better version of the exact same thing, running in the exact same way with no changes to processes
          

---   
    

#### FRA-SCN-TF

Activities that match the _transformative_ _significant change_ type are rare for a cloud service offering, adjusted for the size, scale, and complexity of the service. Small cloud service offerings may go years without _transformative_ changes, while hyperscale providers may release multiple _transformative_ changes per year.

##### Transformative changes

Key Tests:

- Alters the service risk profile or require new or significantly different actions to address customer responsibilities
- Requires significant new design, development and testing with discrete associated project planning, budget, marketing, etc.
- Requires extensive updates to security assessments, documentation, and how a large number of security requirements are met and validated

Examples:

- The addition, removal, or replacement of a critical third party service that handles a significant portion of information (e.g., IaaS change)
- Increasing the security categorization of a service within the offering that actively handles _federal customer data_ (does NOT include impact change of entire offering - see impact categorization change)
- Replacement of underlying management planes or paradigm shift in workload orchestration (e.g., bare-metal servers or virtual machines to containers, migration to kubernetes)
- Datacenter migration where large amounts of _federal customer data_ is moved across boundaries different from normal day-to-day operations
- Adding a new AI-based capability that impacts _federal customer data_ in a different way than existing services or capabilities (such as integrating a new third-party service or training on _federal customer data_)
          

---   
    

#### FRA-SCN-AD

Activities that match the _adaptive_ _significant change_ type are a frequent and normal part of iteratively improving a service by deploying new functionality or modifying existing functionality in a way that is typically transparent to customers and does not introduce significant new security risks.

In general, most changes that do not happen _regularly_ will be _adaptive_ changes. This change type deliberately covers a wide range of activities in a way that requires assessment and consideration.

##### Service adjustments

Key Tests:

- Requires minimal changes to security plans or procedures
- Requires some careful planning and project management to implement, but does not rise to the level of planning required for transformative changes
- Requires verification of existing functionality and secure configuration after implementation

Examples:

- Updates to operating systems, containers, virtual machines, software or libraries with known breaking changes, complex steps, or service disruption
- Deploying larger than normal incremental feature improvements in code or libraries that are the work of multiple weeks of development efforts but are not considered a major new service
- Changing cryptographic modules where the new module meets the same standards and characteristics of the former
- Replacing a like-for-like component where some security plan or procedure adjustments are required (e.g., scanning tool or managed database swap)
- Adding models to existing approved AI services without exposing _federal customer data_ to new services
