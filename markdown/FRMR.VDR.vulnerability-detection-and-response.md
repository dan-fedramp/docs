  - Providers should participate in the FedRAMP Rev5 Community Working Group at https://fedramp.gov/community to follow this process and request participation in the Closed Beta.


### Documentation Guidelines

The following FedRAMP documentation guidelines apply to this document:

- The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
- FedRAMP-specific terms defined in [FRD-ALL (FedRAMP Definitions)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/docs/blob/main/markdown/FRMR.FRD.fedramp-definitions.md) are italicized throughout this document for reference.


## Background & Authority
- [OMB Circular A-130, Managing Information as a Strategic Resource](https://whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/circulars/A130/a130revised.pdf) OMB Circular A-130 defines continuous monitoring as &quot;maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, threats, and incidents to support agency risk management decisions.&quot;
- [44 USC § 3609 (a)(7)](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2023-title44/USCODE-2023-title44-chap36-sec3609) The FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC § 3609 (a)(7)) directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to &quot;coordinate with the FedRAMP Board, the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and other entities identified by the Administrator, with the concurrence of the Director and the Secretary, to establish and regularly update a framework for continuous monitoring...&quot;

### Purpose

The FedRAMP Vulnerability Detection and Response Standard ensures FedRAMP Authorized cloud service offerings use automated systems to effectively and continuously identify, analyze, prioritize, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities and related exposures to threats; and that information related to these activities are effectively and continuously reported to federal agencies for the purposes of ongoing authorization.

The Vulnerability Detection and Response standard defines minimum security requirements that cloud service providers must meet to be FedRAMP Authorized while allowing them flexibility in how they implement and adopt the majority of FedRAMP&#x27;s requirements and recommendations. This creates a marketplace where cloud service providers can compete based on their individual approach and prioritization of security and agencies can choose to adopt cloud services with less effective security programs for less sensitive use cases while prioritizing cloud services with high performing security programs when needed.

Over time, FedRAMP will automatically review the machine-readable authorization data shared by participating cloud service providers to begin scoring cloud service offerings based on how effectively they meet or exceed the requirements and recommendations in this and other FedRAMP 20x standards.

All existing FedRAMP requirements, including control statements, standards, and other guidelines that reference vulnerability scanning or formal Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;Ms) are superseded by this standard and MAY be ignored by providers of cloud service offerings that have met the requirements to adopt this standard with approval by FedRAMP.

### Expected Outcomes

- Cloud service providers following commercial security best practices will be able to meet and validate FedRAMP security requirements with simple changes and automated capabilities
- Federal agencies will be able to easily, quickly, and effectively review and consume security information about the service to make informed risk-based authorizations based on their use cases

> Providers MUST systematically, _persistently_, and _promptly_ discover and identify _vulnerabilities_ within their _cloud service offering_ using appropriate techniques such as assessment, scanning, threat intelligence, vulnerability disclosure mechanisms, bug bounties, supply chain monitoring, and other relevant capabilities; this process is called _vulnerability detection_.

#### FRR-VDR-02
_Applies to:_ Low, Moderate, High

> Providers MUST systematically, _persistently_, and _promptly_ track, evaluate, monitor, _mitigate_, _remediate_, assess exploitation of, report, and otherwise manage all detected vulnerabilities within their _cloud service offering_; this process is called _vulnerability response_.

# Technical assistance

### FRA-VDR

**Purpose:** This Technical Assistance provides additional context behind the intent and goals of certain aspects of this standard that have caused significant confusion or requests for clarification during public comment. This assistance is initially designed for 20x Phase Two/Three and the Rev5 Closed Beta Balance Improvement Test.

**Disclaimer:** Every cloud service provider is different, every architecture is different, and every environment is different. Best practices and technical assistance MUST NOT be used as a checklist. All examples are for discussion purposes ONLY.

****

#### FRA-VDR-01

FedRAMP focuses on internet-reachable (rather than internet-accessible) to ensure that any service that might receive a payload from the internet is prioritized if that service has a vulnerability that can be triggered by processing the data in the payload. The simplest way to prevent exploitation of internet-reachable vulnerabilities is to intercept, inspect, filter, sanitize, reject, or otherwise deflect triggering payloads before they are processed by the vulnerable resource; once this prevention is in place the vulnerability should no longer be considered an internet-reachable vulnerability.

A classic example of an internet-reachable vulnerability on systems that are not typically internet-accessible is SQL injection (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection), where an application stack behind a load balancer and firewall with no ability to route traffic to or from the internet can receive a payload indirectly from the internet that triggers the manipulation or compromise of data in a database that can only be accessed by an authorized connection from the application server on a private network.

Another simple example is the infamous Log4Shell (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) vulnerability from 2021, where exploitation was possible via vulnerable internet-reachable resources deep in the application stack that were often not internet-accessible themselves.


---   
    

#### FRA-VDR-02

The simple reality is that most traditional vulnerabilities discovered by scanners or during assessment are not likely to be exploitable; exploitation typically requires an unrealistic set of circumstances that will not occur during normal operation. The likelihood of exploitation will vary depending on so many factors that FedRAMP will not recommend a specific framework for approaching this beyond the recommendations and requirements in this document.

The proof, ultimately, is in the pudding - providers who regularly evaluate vulnerabilities as not likely exploitable without careful consideration are more likely to suffer from an adverse impact where the root cause was an exploited vulnerability that was improperly evaluated. If done recklessly or deliberately, such actions will have a potential adverse impact on a provider&#x27;s FedRAMP authorization.
