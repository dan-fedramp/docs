FedRAMP anticipates this will change rapidly in response to market demand as platforms work to provide innovative solutions to these requirements.\n\n_* Providers with questions about this should consult with a lawyer who specializes in procurement law. Typically a contract with the government granting ownership of information is required to transfer ownership to the government._",
